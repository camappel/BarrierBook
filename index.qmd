title: "Barrier Book"

Barrier Book is an interactive documentation and analysis site exploring the functioning, operation, meteorological context, and flood defense performance of major storm surge barriers.

This site presents:
- **Barrier closure histories:** Analyzing when and why flood barriers were closed over the past decades.
- **Tidal and water level data:** Processing long-term tide gauge observations and predicted astronomical tides.
- **Meteorological conditions during storms:** Examining wind, pressure, and storm data associated with each closure.
- **Spatio-temporal characteristics:** Exploring the spatial and temporal patterns of storm events and barrier operations.
- **Visualizations:** Comprehensive figures showing barrier operations, extreme sea levels, meteorological extremes, and trends.
- **Workflows and notebooks:** Step-by-step technical analyses and reproducible code using Python and Quarto.

Barrier Book is designed for researchers, civil engineers, and decision-makers interested in flood risk, coastal defense, and climate adaptation.

All analysis code and workflows are open and reproducible, with data sourced from official Dutch and UK agencies.
